# CONNECT 

This is a package created by the Hyve team to provide android passive data stream. We forked this package to add some extra fixes on top of it (android 14 migration for Health Connect)
 

**Don't use the master branch if it is being plugged into the CONNECT app unless there is some need in terms of fixing a bug as the master branch is well ahead and might not be currently compatible with the Cordova plugin**



This package is then being consumed by the **https://github.com/thehyve/radar-prmt-cordova** cordova plugin which is then consumed by our CONNECT app.



## Deploy locally
 
If changes are needed in this plugin, it is necessary to "deploy" this plugin locally: 

```
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```



## Make radar-prmt-cordova consume dependancies locally

Then in the plugin.gradle in **https://github.com/thehyve/radar-prmt-cordova/cordova-plugin-radar-passive/src/android/** make sure to add mavenLocal() to the repositories as a first thing (it should be done by default): 

```
repositories {
    mavenLocal()
    maven { url = "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots" }
    maven { url 'https://repo.thehyve.nl/content/repositories/releases' }
}
```

The "cordova-plugin-radar-passive" then needs to be copied to CONNECT app and the android project recreated to take place (only if you had to change the.

## Refresh the dependencies in the CONNECT App  


if changes were made to this plugin and the cordova-plugin-radar is setup with mavenLocal in the CONNECT App, then pull the new local changes as this: 

```
./gradlew assembleDebug --refresh-dependencies
```





# RADAR-Commons-Android

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RADAR-base/radar-commons-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RADAR-base/radar-commons-android)

Base module for the RADAR passive remote monitoring app. Plugins for that app should implement the API from this base library. Also user interfaces should use this as a base. Currently, the main user interface is [RADAR-AndroidApplication](https://github.com/RADAR-base/radar-prmt-android.git).

Plugins that are implemented as part of RADAR-base are included in the `plugins` directory. Please refer to the README in the respective plugin for information on how to use the plugin.

## Configuration

This library takes the following firebase parameters:

## Usage

Include this repository by adding the following snippet to your Android `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    api 'org.radarbase:radar-commons-android:1.2.2'
}
```

Include additional plugins by adding:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.radarbase:<plugin name>:1.2.2'
}
```

### Creating a plugin

To add source types to the passive remote monitoring Android app, create a plugin using the following steps:

First, create an Android Library project. Include RADAR Commons Android as a module in `build.gradle`.

1. Add the schemas of the data you intend to send to the [RADAR-base Schemas repository](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Schemas). Your record keys should be `org.radarcns.kafka.ObservationKey`. Be sure to set the `namespace` property to `org.radarcns.mydevicetype` so that generated classes will be put in the right package. All values should have `time` and `timeReceived` fields, with type `double`. These represent the time in seconds since the Unix Epoch (1 January 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). Subsecond precision is possible by using floating point decimals. Until those schemas are published, generate them using Avro tools. Find `avro-tools-1.8.2.jar` by going to <http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/avro/>, choosing a mirror, and then downloading `avro-1.8.2/java/avro-tools-1.8.2.jar`. You can now generate source code for a schema `myschema.avsc` with the following command:
    ```shell
    java -jar avro-tools-1.8.2.jar compile -string schema path/to/myschema.avsc path/to/plugin/src/main/java
    ```
    Once the schemas are published as part of the central schemas repository, you can remove the generated files again. Do not publish a non-alpha version of your plugin without the central schemas being published, otherwise there may be class conflicts later on.
2. Create a new package `org.radarbase.passive.mydevicetype`. In that package, create classes that:
    - implement `org.radarbase.android.source.SourceManager` to connect to a device and collect its data, register all Kafka topics in its constructor.
    - if needed, implement a custom `org.radarbase.android.source.SourceState` to keep the current state of the device, or simply use `org.radarbase.android.source.BaseSourceState`.
    - subclass `org.radarbase.android.source.SourceService` to run the device manager in.
    - subclass a `org.radarbase.android.source.SourceProvider` that exposes the new service.
3. Add a new service element to `AndroidManifest.xml`, referencing the newly created device service. Also add all the required permissions there. Set all features as optional.
4. Add the `SourceProvider` you just created to the `plugins` property in `app/src/main/res/xml/remote_config_defaults.xml`.

Publish the resulting data on a maven repository. The plugin can also be created in the `plugins` directory. In that case, open a pull request so we can review the plugin to be added to the set of commons plugins.

### Creating an application

To create an Android App, follow the following steps:

1. Include this module in the Gradle dependencies, and also all plugins that you would like to use
2. Update your code with
     - A main activity that extends `org.radarbase.android.MainActivity`.
     - A main activity view that extends `org.radarbase.android.MainActivityView`. This should reference a layout and update its values based on the services that are connected to the main activity.
     - An application class that implements `org.radarbase.android.RadarApplication` or extends `org.radarbase.android.AbstractRadarApplication`.
     - A service class that extends `org.radarbase.android.RadarService`. Add all plugins that should be enabled in the app to the `plugins` value.
     - A service class that extends `org.radarbase.android.auth.AuthService`. Implement any `org.radarbase.android.auth.LoginManager` classes to be able to log in.
     - A login activity that extends `org.radarbase.android.auth.LoginActivity`.
     - An activity that extends `org.radarbase.android.splash.SplashActivity` and initializes the app. 
     - If wanted, create a `BroadcastListener` that listens to the `ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED` event and starts your `SplashActivity` subclass. Configure it with the `MainActivity.configureRunAtBoot(Class)` method.
3. In `AndroidManifest.xml`, add your application and service. If wanted add your boot-listener to listen to `ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED` events and set `enabled` to `false`.
4. Copy `src/main/res/xml/remote_config_defaults_template.xml` to `app/src/main/res/xml/remote_config_defaults.xml` and insert all needed values there.

## Contributing

For latest code use `dev` branch. Code should be formatted using the [Google Java Code Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), except using 4 spaces as indentation.
To only build plugins that are of interest to you, add a `gradle.skip` file in all plugin directories that should not be built.

If you want to contribute a feature or fix browse our [issues](https://github.com/RADAR-base/radar-commons-android/issues), and please make a pull request.

## Licensing

Code made in the RADAR-base platform is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, as listed in see the LICENSE file in this directory. Plugins that have additional licensing requirements list them in their README.
